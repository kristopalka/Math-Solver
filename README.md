# Math solver
Simple (**Java** & **C**) matlematical expresions calculations e.g.  **"2+3^(1+1)"** will return **"11"**.
You can use it for example as simple command line calculator

## Quick description
- identify simple operations: **+ - * / ^** and brackets **( )**
- works recursively, finding brackets and firstly solving thinks inside them
- C version is pretty fast, because instead of copy string, use markers (Java version isn't ;)
## Run tips
- appropriate functions are in **`Solver.java`** and **`Solver.cc`**
- Java version contains tests in `SilverTest.java`  and example use in `Main.java`
